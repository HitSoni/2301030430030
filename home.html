                    Since its inception in 1990, the Museo Reina Sofia has always been viewed as a cultural center where art retells the
                    history of Spain and gives insight into its future. The 20,000-piece collection focuses primarily on Spanish artists 
                    from the 20th century, but you'll find a number of groundbreaking pieces from international artists like Vasily Kandinsky 
                    and Sarah Grilo.
                    The star of the museum is Pablo Picasso's Guernica, a powerful oil painting depicting the horrors of the Spanish Civil War.
                    Reina Sofia's other signature exhibition of includes the works of Salvador Dalí.

                    <p>
                        Knud W. Jensen's vision was clear: he wanted to create a museum where Danish people could see modern art from their peers. 
                        Though in the years that followed its 1945 founding, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art quickly turned into the predominant 
                        institution of international modernist art and architecture.
                        The 4,000-piece collection encompasses works from 1945 to today from an array of styles including eclectic European Nouveau, 
                        global Realism, and American Art Pop. The institution's main principle is not to simply put things out for show, but educate the 
                        masses about each work and its impact on society.

                        Hidden amidst the bustle of Ho Chi Minh City sits a shocking scene of fighter jets and tanks lined up seemingly ready for action. 
                        While it may appear to be an army base, it's actually the War Remnants Museum which truthfully documents the brutal effects and 
                        tragedies of the Vietnam War through photography and relics. A heavier museum-going experience, the war museum offers insight into
                        a defining chapter of the country's history, and how it has affected the nation's identity today.

                        Inaugurated in 2018, the Museum of Black Civilizations acts as a creative hub for Senegal—and the entire African continent—to celebrate 
                        their culture while detailing the struggle that Africans faced throughout history. The museum was the vision of the country’s first president
                        Léopold Sédar Senghor, who vowed to build an institution honoring African art and identity. While Senghor unfortunately passed before the
                        museum opened, his legacy lives on in the curated art selections and striking displays filling the galleries.
                        The opening of the cultural landmark also spurred a debate amongst the art world, with many scholars calling for museums throughout Europe
                        to return thousands of artifacts looted from Africa during the colonial period.

                        In 1987, Peruvian archaeologist Walter Alva was called upon by police to investigate the Moche archaeological site at Sipán, where grave 
                        robbers had been looting artifacts. When he began excavating the site, Alva soon found he was not unearthing a few pieces of jewelry and 
                        gold, but rather, the tombs of the Lord of Sipán and 14 other members of the Moche civilization.
                        The Museum of the Royal Tombs of Sipán was built to honor and display what has been considered one of the most important archaeological 
                        discoveries in South America. Guests can ogle lavish jewels, regal vessels, and other stunning artifacts of Peru’s ancient community.

                        artwork. The museum’s structures can be traced back to 1782, when they served as the palace of Rama I's viceroy, Prince Wang Na.
                        Nearly 100 years later, the grounds were transformed into a museum with three differently themed galleries: a Thai History Gallery, an 
                        Archaeological and Art History collection, and a Decorative Arts and Ethnological Collection. In addition to the main collections, guests 
                        can discover one of the most revered images of Buddha, Phra Phuttha Sihing, in the Bhuddhaisawan Chapel.

                        The only national museum devoted to the documentation of the African American experience, this Smithsonian institution was inaugurated in 2016.
                        However, the idea of the museum was first proposed more than a hundred years before in 1915 by Black veterans of the Civil War. The initial 
                        proposal called for a monument to be erected in the honor of Black soldiers and sailors in the nation’s capital, but debates over funding and 
                        site locations kept pushing the project back.
                        It wasn't until 2003 when an Act of Congress established the institution and construction plans began. Today, the National Museum of African
                        American History and Culture houses more than 40,000 objects dedicated to African American life, history, and culture.

                        When the National Gallery of Canada was established in 1880, the first exhibition primarily consisted of 19th-century works at the historic
                        Clarendon Hotel in Ottawa. Over 140 years later, a 30-foot bronze spider called the Maman greets visitors at the gallery’s new home designed by 
                        architect Moshe Safdie.
                        The national art museum now houses 75,000 works of art ranging from Canadian and Indigenous pieces to the neoclassicist painting The Death of
                        General Wolfe by Benjamin West.

                        collection of Pharaonic antiquities. The museum was commissioned in 1835 by the Egyptian government in hopes to stop the looting of many
                        archeological and historic sites. Visitors can come face to face with the gold mask of Tutankhamun, which is composed of 11 kilograms of

                        by Renzo Piano. After the Great Fire of 1871, Chicago leaders were devoted to rebuilding and growing the city, which included opening a museum 
                        and school for the fine arts.
                        The Art Institute found its permanent home at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Adams Street in 1893 with two bronze lions marking the front
                        entrance of the museum. Gustave Caillebotte's Paris Street; Rainy Day and Grant Wood's American Gothic are among the Institute's massive
